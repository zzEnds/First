	/**
	 * A guy named Vasya attends the final grade of a high school. 
	 * One day Vasya decided to watch a match of his favorite hockey team. 
	 * And, as the boy loves hockey very much, even more than physics, he forgot to do the homework. 
	 * Specifically, he forgot to complete his physics tasks. 
	 * Next day the teacher got very angry at Vasya and decided to teach him a lesson. 
	 * 
	 * He gave the lazy student a seemingly easy task: 
	 * You are given an idle body in space and the forces that affect it. 
	 * The body can be considered as a material point with coordinates (0; 0; 0). 
	 * Vasya had only to answer whether it is in equilibrium. 
	 * "Piece of cake" â€” thought Vasya, we need only to check if the sum of all vectors is equal to 0. 
	 * So, Vasya began to solve the problem. 
	 * But later it turned out that there can be lots and lots of these forces, 
	 * and Vasya can not cope without your help. 
	 * 
	 * Help him. Write a program that determines whether a body is idle or 
	 * is moving by the given vectors of forces.
