	/**
	 * The end of the school year is near and Ms. Manana, the teacher, 
	 * will soon have to say goodbye to a yet another class. 
	 * She decided to prepare a goodbye present for her n students 
	 * and give each of them a jigsaw puzzle 
	 * (which, as wikipedia states, is a tiling puzzle that requires the assembly of numerous small, 
	 * often oddly shaped, interlocking and tessellating pieces). 
	 * The shop assistant told the teacher that there are m puzzles in the shop, 
	 * but they might differ in difficulty and size. Specifically, 
	 * the first jigsaw puzzle consists of f1 pieces, the second one consists of f2 pieces and so on. 
	 * Ms. Manana doesn't want to upset the children, 
	 * so she decided that the difference between the numbers of pieces in her presents 
	 * must be as small as possible. Let A be the number of pieces in the largest puzzle 
	 * that the teacher buys and B be the number of pieces in the smallest such puzzle. 
	 * She wants to choose such n puzzles that A - B is minimum possible. 
	 * Help the teacher and find the least possible value of A - B.
